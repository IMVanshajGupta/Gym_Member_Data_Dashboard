# 🏋️ Gym Members Health & Workout Insights Dashboard

## 📋 Project Overview
This project involves the complete lifecycle of data analysis — from **data extraction** to **dashboard creation** — focusing on gym members' fitness and workout data.  
The goal is to showcase how raw gym data can be transformed into actionable business insights using **Power BI**, **Power Query**, and **DAX**.

---

## 📂 Data Source
- Dataset taken from **Kaggle**.
- Contains information about **973 gym members** in a **single table**.
- Key attributes include:  
  - Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI
  - Fat Percentage
  - Max BPM & Resting BPM
  - Workout Type
  - Workout Frequency (days/week)
  - Session Duration (hours)
  - Water Intake (liters)
  - Calories Burned
  - Experience Level

## 🛠️ Project Steps

### 1. Understanding the Data
- Analyzed the raw structure to identify key business questions.
- Decided what metrics could provide the most valuable insights (health metrics, workout preferences, hydration, calories burned, etc.).

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Used **Power Query Editor** in Power BI:
  - Removed unnecessary columns.
  - Created **custom columns** with conditional logic (e.g., age categories).
  - Handled missing or inconsistent values.
  - Reformatted fields for better analysis.

### 3. Feature Engineering using DAX
- Created **new measures** using DAX to extract deeper meaning:
  - Average workout session by age group.
  - Average calories burned per workout type.
  - Max BPM vs Resting BPM analysis.
  - Hydration analysis by workout frequency.

### 4. Dashboard Building
- Built 3 dedicated report pages:
  - **Member Overview** — demographic breakdown and experience levels.
  - **Workout Analysis** — session durations, workout frequency, and workout type comparisons.
  - **Fitness Health Insights** — weight, fat %, BPM analysis, calories burned by workout.
- Used a combination of:
  - Bar charts
  - Line charts
  - Donut charts
  - Stacked columns
  - Slicers for dynamic filtering (Age, Gender, Workout Type).

### 5. Visualization Enhancements
- Created a **dark theme** for a modern, professional look.
- Added tooltips, labels, and cross-filtering across visuals for a smoother user experience.
- Ensured the dashboard is fully **interactive** and **easy to navigate**.
